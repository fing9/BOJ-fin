### 문제 설명

<p>Fisherman Šime caught N tunas last night. With the help of a special app, he offerred them for sale to a famous Japanese company that specializes in purchasing quality fish. In what way does the app estimate the value, or the price, of a tuna?</p>

<p>Based on the photo of the tuna, the app returns two estimated values, P1 and P2 . If the difference between the estimates is less than or equal to X, then the higher value is taken. If the difference is strictly larger than X, the app returns a third estimate P3 and then that estimate is taken as the final value of the tuna.</p>

<p>Write a programme that will, based on the given estimates (sometimes two, sometimes three of them) for each of N tunas, output the total value of caught tunas.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20), the number of tunas from the task.</p>

<p>The second line of input contains the integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ 10), the number from the task.</p>

<p>Then, N blocks follow in one of the two following forms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In one line, two integers P1 and P2 (1 ≤ P1 , P2 ≤ 100) from the task, or</li>
	<li>In one line, two integers P1 and P2 (1 ≤ P1 , P2 ≤ 100) from the task, and in the second line integer P3 (1 ≤ P3 ≤ 100) from the task.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the total value of caught tunas.</p>
